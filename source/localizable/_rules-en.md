### 1. « Cloud » instance, data hosting service

The data hosting service, called « cloud », is a standard NextCloud instance, where only the theme is customized. The service includes the hosting, sharing, and organization of files. The integrated "Announcements" application is used by the administration team to send messages to the users before any maintenance action (an update for instance).

### 2. Discussion forum, Flarum

The discussion forum provided is a Flarum instance with a few extensions and a french translation of the software. It aims to make communication between users and project administrators easier. Obviously, the usual mutual respect rules are to be respected, no sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc behavior will be tolerated. We also forbid any kind of agism or classism, like in all other spaces of the project we want to promote respect of each other and solidarity.

Anybody who will not follow these rules will have its access to all the project's service removed, without any previous notification.
